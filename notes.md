- Use iLovePDF idea of to separate the upload of images and videos on different pages, so it doesn't crowd the page. The idea is to have like an intro page and have the user pick either to upload image or video. So that they are been taken to an image specific page just for images and the same for videos.
- The idea of extracting frames from videos is alright, but I want to include like intervals in the videos to identify areas which are fake and real, and the intervals are highlighted and when you click it does to that part of the video that has been clicked, so that we can solve the problem of multiple faces identified which might be real, so it just doesn't classify the entire video as fake or real but intervals of the video.
